Machine Learning Course Homework
===============================
Hw1: PM2.5 Prediction
---
* Regression
* Done by handcraft gradient descent

Hw2: Income Prediction
---
* Binary classification (higher income or lower income)
* Done by handcraft cross_entropy

Hw3: Image Sentiment Classification
---
* Classification (7 classes, 7 kinds of sentiment)
* Done by CNN (keras)

Hw4: Image Sentiment Classification -> Explain Model
---
### Task 1: Sailency Map
### Task 2: Filter Visualization
### Task 3: Lime
* Explain Hw3's model

Hw5: Black box attack
---
* Adversarial attack by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
* Black box is one of the pretrained model (VGG, ResNet, DenseNet)
* Done by keras

Hw6: Malicious Comments Identification
---
* Binary classification (decide whether comments are malicious or not)
* Use RNN to differentiate comments
* Done by keras

Hw7: Unsupervised Learning
---
### Task 1: PCA of colored faces
* Including dimension reduction and image reconstruction
### Task 2: Image clustering (Binary Classification, decide whether two images come from the same dataset or not)
* Use autoencoder and different kinds of technique to reduce dimensions
* Done by keras

Hw8: Image Sentiment Classification (Same as Hw3)
---
* Classification (7 classes, 7 kinds of sentiment)
* Done by **MobileNet** (keras)
* Aimed to reduce size of model with only a little bit worse performance on accuracy
